            Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability. Developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java is platform-independent, meaning programs written in Java can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Its object-oriented nature makes it easier to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code, which is essential for modern software development. Java is used in various applications, from web and mobile development to enterprise systems and embedded devices. Additionally, its extensive library ecosystem and active community support make it a popular choice for developers worldwide.</p>
